# Python_Hotel
With this small script, I've created a Hotel service system for guests.

How to use:

1) Download all the files to your own device (make sure everything is in the same directory).
2) Open up the Index.py file and run it.

With this code, a use can checkin, checkout, add reservations and remove reservations.
